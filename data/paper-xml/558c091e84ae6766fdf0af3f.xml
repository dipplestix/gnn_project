    <ns0:title>Discrete Signal Processing on Graphs: Frequency Analysis</ns0:title>
    <ns0:summary>  Signals and datasets that arise in physical and engineering applications, as
well as social, genetics, biomolecular, and many other domains, are becoming
increasingly larger and more complex. In contrast to traditional time and image
signals, data in these domains are supported by arbitrary graphs. Signal
processing on graphs extends concepts and techniques from traditional signal
processing to data indexed by generic graphs. This paper studies the concepts
of low and high frequencies on graphs, and low-, high-, and band-pass graph
filters. In traditional signal processing, there concepts are easily defined
because of a natural frequency ordering that has a physical interpretation. For
signals residing on graphs, in general, there is no obvious frequency ordering.
We propose a definition of total variation for graph signals that naturally
leads to a frequency ordering on graphs and defines low-, high-, and band-pass
graph signals and filters. We study the design of graph filters with specified
frequency response, and illustrate our approach with applications to sensor
malfunction detection and data classification.
