    <ns0:title>BinaryConnect: Training Deep Neural Networks with binary weights during
  propagations</ns0:title>
    <ns0:summary>  Deep Neural Networks (DNN) have achieved state-of-the-art results in a wide
range of tasks, with the best results obtained with large training sets and
large models. In the past, GPUs enabled these breakthroughs because of their
greater computational speed. In the future, faster computation at both training
and test time is likely to be crucial for further progress and for consumer
applications on low-power devices. As a result, there is much interest in
research and development of dedicated hardware for Deep Learning (DL). Binary
weights, i.e., weights which are constrained to only two possible values (e.g.
-1 or 1), would bring great benefits to specialized DL hardware by replacing
many multiply-accumulate operations by simple accumulations, as multipliers are
the most space and power-hungry components of the digital implementation of
neural networks. We introduce BinaryConnect, a method which consists in
training a DNN with binary weights during the forward and backward
propagations, while retaining precision of the stored weights in which
gradients are accumulated. Like other dropout schemes, we show that
BinaryConnect acts as regularizer and we obtain near state-of-the-art results
with BinaryConnect on the permutation-invariant MNIST, CIFAR-10 and SVHN.
