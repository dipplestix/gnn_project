    <ns0:title>Adam: A Method for Stochastic Optimization</ns0:title>
    <ns0:summary>  We introduce Adam, an algorithm for first-order gradient-based optimization
of stochastic objective functions, based on adaptive estimates of lower-order
moments. The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally
efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling
of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of
data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary
objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The
hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little
tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are
discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the
algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable
to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework.
Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares
favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax,
a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.
