    <ns0:title>A Generic Deep Architecture for Single Image Reflection Removal and
  Image Smoothing</ns0:title>
    <ns0:summary>  This paper proposes a deep neural network structure that exploits edge
information in addressing representative low-level vision tasks such as layer
separation and image filtering. Unlike most other deep learning strategies
applied in this context, our approach tackles these challenging problems by
estimating edges and reconstructing images using only cascaded convolutional
layers arranged such that no handcrafted or application-specific
image-processing components are required. We apply the resulting transferrable
pipeline to two different problem domains that are both sensitive to edges,
namely, single image reflection removal and image smoothing. For the former,
using a mild reflection smoothness assumption and a novel synthetic data
generation method that acts as a type of weak supervision, our network is able
to solve much more difficult reflection cases that cannot be handled by
previous methods. For the latter, we also exceed the state-of-the-art
quantitative and qualitative results by wide margins. In all cases, the
proposed framework is simple, fast, and easy to transfer across disparate
domains.
