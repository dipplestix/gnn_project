    <ns0:title>Content and Network Dynamics Behind Egyptian Political Polarization on
  Twitter</ns0:title>
    <ns0:summary>  There is little doubt about whether social networks play a role in modern
protests. This agreement has triggered an entire research avenue, in which
social structure and content analysis have been central --but are typically
exploited separately.
  Here, we combine these two approaches to shed light on the opinion evolution
dynamics in Egypt during the summer of 2013 along two axes
(Islamist/Secularist, pro/anti-military intervention). We intend to find traces
of opinion changes in Egypt's population, paralleling those in the
international community --which oscillated from sympathetic to condemnatory as
civil clashes grew. We find little evidence of people "switching" sides, along
with clear changes in volume in both pro- and anti-military camps.
  Our work contributes new insights into the dynamics of large protest
movements, specially in the aftermath of the main events --rather unattended
previously. It questions the standard narrative concerning a simplistic mapping
between Secularist/pro-military and Islamist/anti-military. Finally, our
conclusions provide empirical validation to sociological models regarding the
behavior of individuals in conflictive contexts.
