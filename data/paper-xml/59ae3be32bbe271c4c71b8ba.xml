    <ns0:title>Convolutional 2D Knowledge Graph Embeddings</ns0:title>
    <ns0:summary>  Link prediction for knowledge graphs is the task of predicting missing
relationships between entities. Previous work on link prediction has focused on
shallow, fast models which can scale to large knowledge graphs. However, these
models learn less expressive features than deep, multi-layer models -- which
potentially limits performance. In this work, we introduce ConvE, a multi-layer
convolutional network model for link prediction, and report state-of-the-art
results for several established datasets. We also show that the model is highly
parameter efficient, yielding the same performance as DistMult and R-GCN with
8x and 17x fewer parameters. Analysis of our model suggests that it is
particularly effective at modelling nodes with high indegree -- which are
common in highly-connected, complex knowledge graphs such as Freebase and
YAGO3. In addition, it has been noted that the WN18 and FB15k datasets suffer
from test set leakage, due to inverse relations from the training set being
present in the test set -- however, the extent of this issue has so far not
been quantified. We find this problem to be severe: a simple rule-based model
can achieve state-of-the-art results on both WN18 and FB15k. To ensure that
models are evaluated on datasets where simply exploiting inverse relations
cannot yield competitive results, we investigate and validate several commonly
used datasets -- deriving robust variants where necessary. We then perform
experiments on these robust datasets for our own and several previously
proposed models and find that ConvE achieves state-of-the-art Mean Reciprocal
Rank across most datasets.
