    <ns0:title>Deep Generative Stochastic Networks Trainable by Backprop</ns0:title>
    <ns0:summary>  We introduce a novel training principle for probabilistic models that is an
alternative to maximum likelihood. The proposed Generative Stochastic Networks
(GSN) framework is based on learning the transition operator of a Markov chain
whose stationary distribution estimates the data distribution. The transition
distribution of the Markov chain is conditional on the previous state,
generally involving a small move, so this conditional distribution has fewer
dominant modes, being unimodal in the limit of small moves. Thus, it is easier
to learn because it is easier to approximate its partition function, more like
learning to perform supervised function approximation, with gradients that can
be obtained by backprop. We provide theorems that generalize recent work on the
probabilistic interpretation of denoising autoencoders and obtain along the way
an interesting justification for dependency networks and generalized
pseudolikelihood, along with a definition of an appropriate joint distribution
and sampling mechanism even when the conditionals are not consistent. GSNs can
be used with missing inputs and can be used to sample subsets of variables
given the rest. We validate these theoretical results with experiments on two
image datasets using an architecture that mimics the Deep Boltzmann Machine
Gibbs sampler but allows training to proceed with simple backprop, without the
need for layerwise pretraining.
