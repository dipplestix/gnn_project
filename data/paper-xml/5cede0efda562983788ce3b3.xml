    <ns0:title>On the Universality of Invariant Networks</ns0:title>
    <ns0:summary>  Constraining linear layers in neural networks to respect symmetry
transformations from a group $G$ is a common design principle for invariant
networks that has found many applications in machine learning.
  In this paper, we consider a fundamental question that has received little
attention to date: Can these networks approximate any (continuous) invariant
function?
  We tackle the rather general case where $G\leq S_n$ (an arbitrary subgroup of
the symmetric group) that acts on $\mathbb{R}^n$ by permuting coordinates. This
setting includes several recent popular invariant networks. We present two main
results: First, $G$-invariant networks are universal if high-order tensors are
allowed. Second, there are groups $G$ for which higher-order tensors are
unavoidable for obtaining universality.
  $G$-invariant networks consisting of only first-order tensors are of special
interest due to their practical value. We conclude the paper by proving a
necessary condition for the universality of $G$-invariant networks that
incorporate only first-order tensors.
