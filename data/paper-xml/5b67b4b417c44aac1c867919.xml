    <ns0:title>Representation Learning with Contrastive Predictive Coding</ns0:title>
    <ns0:summary>  While supervised learning has enabled great progress in many applications,
unsupervised learning has not seen such widespread adoption, and remains an
important and challenging endeavor for artificial intelligence. In this work,
we propose a universal unsupervised learning approach to extract useful
representations from high-dimensional data, which we call Contrastive
Predictive Coding. The key insight of our model is to learn such
representations by predicting the future in latent space by using powerful
autoregressive models. We use a probabilistic contrastive loss which induces
the latent space to capture information that is maximally useful to predict
future samples. It also makes the model tractable by using negative sampling.
While most prior work has focused on evaluating representations for a
particular modality, we demonstrate that our approach is able to learn useful
representations achieving strong performance on four distinct domains: speech,
images, text and reinforcement learning in 3D environments.
