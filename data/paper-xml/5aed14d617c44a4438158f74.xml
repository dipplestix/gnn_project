    <ns0:title>Lip Movements Generation at a Glance</ns0:title>
    <ns0:summary>  Cross-modality generation is an emerging topic that aims to synthesize data
in one modality based on information in a different modality. In this paper, we
consider a task of such: given an arbitrary audio speech and one lip image of
arbitrary target identity, generate synthesized lip movements of the target
identity saying the speech. To perform well in this task, it inevitably
requires a model to not only consider the retention of target identity,
photo-realistic of synthesized images, consistency and smoothness of lip images
in a sequence, but more importantly, learn the correlations between audio
speech and lip movements. To solve the collective problems, we explore the best
modeling of the audio-visual correlations in building and training a
lip-movement generator network. Specifically, we devise a method to fuse audio
and image embeddings to generate multiple lip images at once and propose a
novel correlation loss to synchronize lip changes and speech changes. Our final
model utilizes a combination of four losses for a comprehensive consideration
in generating lip movements; it is trained in an end-to-end fashion and is
robust to lip shapes, view angles and different facial characteristics.
Thoughtful experiments on three datasets ranging from lab-recorded to lips
in-the-wild show that our model significantly outperforms other
state-of-the-art methods extended to this task.
