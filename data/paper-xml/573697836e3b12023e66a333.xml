    <ns0:title>Deep Neural Networks are Easily Fooled: High Confidence Predictions for
  Unrecognizable Images</ns0:title>
    <ns0:summary>  Deep neural networks (DNNs) have recently been achieving state-of-the-art
performance on a variety of pattern-recognition tasks, most notably visual
classification problems. Given that DNNs are now able to classify objects in
images with near-human-level performance, questions naturally arise as to what
differences remain between computer and human vision. A recent study revealed
that changing an image (e.g. of a lion) in a way imperceptible to humans can
cause a DNN to label the image as something else entirely (e.g. mislabeling a
lion a library). Here we show a related result: it is easy to produce images
that are completely unrecognizable to humans, but that state-of-the-art DNNs
believe to be recognizable objects with 99.99% confidence (e.g. labeling with
certainty that white noise static is a lion). Specifically, we take
convolutional neural networks trained to perform well on either the ImageNet or
MNIST datasets and then find images with evolutionary algorithms or gradient
ascent that DNNs label with high confidence as belonging to each dataset class.
It is possible to produce images totally unrecognizable to human eyes that DNNs
believe with near certainty are familiar objects, which we call "fooling
images" (more generally, fooling examples). Our results shed light on
interesting differences between human vision and current DNNs, and raise
questions about the generality of DNN computer vision.
