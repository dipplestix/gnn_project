    <ns0:title>Discriminative Unsupervised Feature Learning with Exemplar Convolutional
  Neural Networks</ns0:title>
    <ns0:summary>  Deep convolutional networks have proven to be very successful in learning
task specific features that allow for unprecedented performance on various
computer vision tasks. Training of such networks follows mostly the supervised
learning paradigm, where sufficiently many input-output pairs are required for
training. Acquisition of large training sets is one of the key challenges, when
approaching a new task. In this paper, we aim for generic feature learning and
present an approach for training a convolutional network using only unlabeled
data. To this end, we train the network to discriminate between a set of
surrogate classes. Each surrogate class is formed by applying a variety of
transformations to a randomly sampled 'seed' image patch. In contrast to
supervised network training, the resulting feature representation is not class
specific. It rather provides robustness to the transformations that have been
applied during training. This generic feature representation allows for
classification results that outperform the state of the art for unsupervised
learning on several popular datasets (STL-10, CIFAR-10, Caltech-101,
Caltech-256). While such generic features cannot compete with class specific
features from supervised training on a classification task, we show that they
are advantageous on geometric matching problems, where they also outperform the
SIFT descriptor.
